# StringListEditor
A string list editor function implemented using python dictionaries. Takes in three lists (an original list, an add list, and a delete list) and outputs a new output string list. All elements in add list that are not in original list are added to the new string list and all elements in the delete list that are in the newlist after the add list elements have been added are removed. The new output list is sorted by descending element length first then reverse alphabetical in case of a tie.
